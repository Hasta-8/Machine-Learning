# 🚗 Car Sales Price Prediction — EDA, Hypothesis Testing & MLR

This project dives deep into the process of predicting used car selling prices using real-world data. The notebook combines **exploratory data analysis**, **hypothesis testing**, **data preprocessing**, and **multiple linear regression** to build a robust analytical workflow.

## 📊 What’s Covered

- 📌 **EDA**: Outlier detection, correlation heatmaps, distribution analysis  
- 🧪 **Hypothesis Testing**:
  - Two-sample T-tests
  - ANOVA
  - Z-test
  - Chi-square
  - Paired tests and non-parametric alternatives (Mann–Whitney, Kruskal–Wallis)
- 🔧 **Preprocessing**:
  - Unit cleaning (e.g., converting string-based values to numeric)
  - Missing value imputation
  - Feature engineering (car age, categorical encoding)
  - Feature scaling (MinMax, StandardScaler, etc.)
- 📈 **Modeling**:
  - Multiple Linear Regression with log-transformed target variable
  - Model evaluation and interpretation
