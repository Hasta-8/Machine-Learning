# 🎬 Movie Recommendation Systems: Collaborative vs. Content-Based Filtering

This project demonstrates how to build and compare movie recommendation systems using two main approaches: **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering**.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The analysis utilizes the **MovieLens dataset**, specifically the following files:
- `movies_metadata.csv`
- `ratings_small.csv`

These files contain movie metadata and user ratings, and are preprocessed for analysis.

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used

### 🔗 Collaborative Filtering

- A **User-Item Matrix** is created to represent user ratings for different movies.
- `NearestNeighbors` from `sklearn` is used with **cosine similarity** to find similar movies based on user rating patterns.
- Recommendations are generated based on how users have rated other similar movies.

### 📄 Content-Based Filtering

- **Movie overviews** are used as the content for similarity analysis.
- Two different vectorization techniques are applied:
  - `CountVectorizer`: Builds a Document-Term Matrix (DTM) using bigrams.
  - `TF-IDF Vectorizer`: Builds a TF-IDF matrix to reflect word importance across the corpus.
- **Cosine similarity** is used to measure similarity between movies based on their textual content.
- Recommendations are generated by finding movies with similar descriptions.

## 📌 Conclusions

This notebook provides a comparative view of the two recommendation approaches:

- ✅ **Collaborative Filtering** recommends movies that are often enjoyed by the same users, regardless of content similarity.
- ✅ **Content-Based Filtering** recommends movies with similar overviews, regardless of user ratings.
- 💡 A **hybrid approach** combining both methods could offer more comprehensive and relevant recommendations.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Upload the required dataset files (`movies_metadata.csv`, `ratings_small.csv`).
3. Follow the notebook cells to explore and generate recommendations.
