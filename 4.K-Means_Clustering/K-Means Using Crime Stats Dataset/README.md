This notebook aims to cluster Indian States and Union Territories based on their crime statistics for the year 2022. The objective is to group states with similar crime patterns using unsupervised learning techniques.

The dataset used is "CrimeStats.csv", which contains various crime statistics for each state and union territory in India.

The notebook follows these steps:

Data Loading and Preparation: The dataset is loaded, and the 'State/UT' column is separated as it's not needed for clustering. The remaining numerical features are then scaled using StandardScaler to ensure that no single feature dominates the clustering process due to its magnitude.
K-Means Clustering: The K-Means algorithm is applied to the scaled data. The elbow method and silhouette score are used to determine the optimal number of clusters, which is chosen as 5. The states are then clustered into these 5 groups, and the results are visualized.
Hierarchical Clustering: Hierarchical clustering is performed, and a dendrogram is generated to visualize the clustering process and potential groupings.
DBSCAN Clustering: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is implemented. The epsilon (eps) parameter is determined using the Nearest Neighbors algorithm and visualized with a plot. DBSCAN is then applied with the calculated epsilon and a specified minimum number of samples. The results are visualized.
Challenges:

Determining the optimal number of clusters: Both the elbow method and silhouette score provide insights, but the final choice often involves some interpretation.
Visualizing clusters in higher dimensions: While scatter plots are used, visualizing clusters based on all features simultaneously is challenging. The notebook focuses on key features for visualization.
Conclusions and Key Takeaways:

Based on the K-Means clustering with K=5, states can be grouped into different crime level categories (e.g., low, medium, high, very high).
Uttar Pradesh appears as an outlier with very high crime statistics, forming its own cluster in the K-Means analysis.
The silhouette score analysis suggests that while 2 clusters have the highest score, 5 clusters provide a more nuanced segmentation of the states.
Hierarchical clustering provides an alternative perspective on the relationships between states based on crime data.
DBSCAN identifies clusters based on density and also highlights potential outliers.
Overall, the notebook successfully demonstrates the application of different clustering techniques to crime statistics data to identify states with similar crime profiles.
